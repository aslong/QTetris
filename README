QTetrisWindow -> holds the whole game.

TetrisGrid -> handles the blocks and game logic for tetris game.

Block -> A block to represent a tile in the game.


Game logic:

As time ticks down. A block is released from the top of the scene and it begins
to fall toward the bottom of the scene. The block can be rotated by 90 degrees by
the player to allow it to fit between other blocks. As blocks fall down the goal
is to completely fill a horizontal row of blocks. This will elimate the row, shift
all blocks above, down one. When the rows of blocks go higher than a set limit,
the game is over and you lose. If the user is able to play through a set number
of fallen blocks without going over the vertical limit, they move on to the next
level.

Ideas:

- With friends

Requirements:

* Support standard set of tetris blocks
* Filling row removes the row of blocks and moves other blocks down
* Scoring for number of rows removed
* Levels by score
* Pause game
* Show next block coming up
* Colorize blocks
